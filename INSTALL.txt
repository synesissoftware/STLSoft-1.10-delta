============================================================================

 STLSoft is a 100% header-only library, and so requires no building.

 Because this version of STLSoft is an alpha, with deltas, you need to
 install STLSoft 1.9, and the install STLSoft 1.10 delta. There are two
 ways you can do this:

 1. Separate directories

  Download and unzip the latest version of STLSoft 1.9, and define an
  STLSOFT environment variable pointing to the directory. For example, if
  you you install to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.101, then you
  should set STLSOFT to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.9.101. In that case,
  the file stlsoft/stlsoft.h will be located in
  $STLSOFT/include/stlsoft/stlsoft.h

  Then, download and unzip the STLSoft 1.10 delta, and define an
  STLSOFT_1_10 environment variable pointing to the directory. For example,
  if you you install to /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.10.1-alpha-23-delta,
  then you should set STLSOFT_1_10 to
  /usr/local/stlsoft/stlsoft-1.10.1-alpha-23-delta. In that case,
  the file stlsoft/stlsoft_1_10.h will be located in
  $STLSOFT_1_10/include/stlsoft/stlsoft_1_10.h

  To use the libraries, you must ensure that the $STLSOFT_1_10/include
  directory is **before** the $STLSOFT/include directory in your include
  paths.

  If you're using STLSoft on UNIX, you might want to apply dos2unix over all
  the files before using it. You *must* do this if you're using the SunPro
  C compiler.

 2. Overwriting 

  Alternatively, you can download and install STLSoft 1.9 as described
  above, and then download and unzip STLSoft 1.10 over the existing STLSoft
  1.9 files.
  
  The advantage of this method is that you can continue to use only one
  STLSoft include directory, $STLSOFT/include.

  The disadvantage is that unzipping future delta releases of STLSoft 1.10
  is not guaranteed to work without emptying the composite directory and
  reinstalling STLSoft 1.9 beforehand. Consequently, to use this method you
  should reinstal STLSoft 1.9 every time, followed by the latest STLSoft
  1.10 distribution.
